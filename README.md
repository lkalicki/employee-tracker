# employee-tracker

## Description 

The Employee Tracker is designed to help manage employee content through the use of Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. It creates a database that includes departments, role, and employee info, as well as an application that allows updates, additions, and deletions to be made to said database from the Command Prompt. 

## Installation

In order to install the Employee Tracker, the user must download the code and then initialize the directory to run Node.js, as well as download the inquirer package, mysql, and Express. Then, utilizing the Command Prompt, they can leverage mysql to create the database and then use node to make any changes to the database. 

## Usage 

To run the application, enter 'node server.js' in the command prompt and select the desired actions.

A Walkthrough video of the Employee Tracker is available [here](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/goSDy53S5Dt5nLVwAiz3).

Future areas of opportunity include adding total budget per department as well as fine tuning manager layouts so that managers from different departments do not get selected to manager employees outside their departments, etc.
